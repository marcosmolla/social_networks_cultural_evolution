## Expected number of traits and average lifetime of traits under neutrality

Here is a simple [calculator](https://smolla.shinyapps.io/Expected_K_and_T/) to uses population size $N$ and innovation rate $\mu$ as an input to calculate the expected number of traits in a popualtion at any point in time and the average time till a new trait is lost from the population. 

More soon.
